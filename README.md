# Chat2Codex

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Run Codex on your own machine from Feishu/Lark or Weixin chat.

Chat2Codex turns a chat bot into a message platform for the local Codex CLI.
Send prompts, files, and images; receive progress and final answers; approve
Codex actions; and resume local Codex threads without a public webhook server.
For Weixin direct messages, named tasks route ordinary language to the intended
workspace and can return explicitly declared text, image, and file results.

## Current Status

- Production adapters are Feishu/Lark long connection and native Weixin
  ClawBot iLink long polling. Select exactly one per process with
  `CHAT2CODEX_ADAPTER=feishu|weixin`; the omitted selector remains `feishu`.
  See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md).
- Direct-message routing is enabled by default, but every sender or direct chat
  must be explicitly allowlisted except for `/whoami` discovery.
- UsageAdvisor is a bounded review surface: operational friction produces redacted
  code-owned proposals, while approval permits planning only; it never applies, executes, or deploys a change.
- Group chats are disabled by default and require both chat and sender
  allowlists. They can be constrained to `CODEX_GROUP_ALLOWED_ROOTS`.
- The Codex app-server protocol is experimental. Run `chat2codex doctor` and
  the checks in [Codex App-Server Guardrails](#codex-app-server-guardrails)
  after installing or upgrading Codex CLI.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js `>= 20.12.0`
- npm for installing the package.
- Codex CLI installed and logged in on the machine running this bridge.
- Either a Feishu/Lark account that can create a bot app, or a personal Weixin
  account with the ClawBot entry enabled.
- The app needs message receive/send/resource permissions, long-connection
  event subscriptions for message events, and the `card.action.trigger`
  callback.

### Install And Run

```bash
npm install -g chat2codex
```

Create and connect a Feishu/Lark app automatically by scanning a QR code:

```bash
chat2codex setup --workdir /absolute/path/to/your/repo
```

The setup command renders a terminal QR code and keeps the authorization URL as
a fallback. Scan it with Feishu/Lark, confirm the app creation, and it writes
`FEISHU_APP_ID`, `FEISHU_APP_SECRET`, `LARK_DOMAIN`, and the scanning user's
`open_id` in `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` to
`~/.chat2codex/.env`. You can still run
`chat2codex init --workdir /absolute/path/to/your/repo` and edit that env file
manually if you already have an app. After the first start, `/whoami` remains
available for discovering ids that need to be allowlisted.

Check the local setup, then start the bridge:

```bash
chat2codex doctor
chat2codex start
```

For Weixin, connect Chat2Codex directly to ClawBot instead:

```bash
chat2codex setup weixin --workdir /absolute/path/to/your/repo
```

The QR flow handles confirmation, numeric verification, IDC redirects, and
expiry refresh. It writes `CHAT2CODEX_ADAPTER=weixin`, the work directory, and
the scanning user's stable iLink id to the env allowlist. Bot Token, Bot ID,
API base URL, and user ID are stored with mode `0600` in
`~/.chat2codex/weixin/credentials.json`, never in `.env`. This route uses the
native iLink HTTP protocol; OpenClaw is not installed or run.
The machine still has to stay powered on, online, and running the Chat2Codex
service; ClawBot is only the transport and does not run another agent or model.

Send a DM to the bot:

```text
/status
Summarize this repository.
```

You can also send files and images. Feishu/Lark keeps the existing immediate
attachment behavior. Weixin image-only messages instead build a durable draft:
send one to four images first, then send the instruction text. Images alone do
not start Codex. A fifth image is rejected and deleted while the first four
remain staged. A draft expires after `WEIXIN_IMAGE_DRAFT_TTL_MS`; an explicit
request to abandon the images deletes it, while ambiguous text leaves it intact
and asks for clarification.

Weixin direct messages also accept ordinary task language such as “start a
Travel task for Japan hotels”, “continue the Japan hotel task”, “stop the
finance analysis”, or “approve this turn for the hotel task”. A target is never
guessed for a destructive or permission-bearing action. When a name could mean
multiple tasks or workspaces, Chat2Codex asks one bounded question and preserves
the pending task, interaction, and image state. Slash commands remain available
as deterministic compatibility and recovery controls.

During a run, Chat2Codex adds a processing reaction below the original message
and sends throttled plain-text progress at most once every 30 seconds. The
processing reaction is removed when the run ends; failures receive a failure
reaction. The final Codex response is sent as a rendered rich-text post. Send
`/stop` to abort the active run and `/retry` to re-run the latest remembered
prompt. Run details remain available through `/summary`, `/files`, `/diff`, and
`/logs`. If message reactions are unavailable, Chat2Codex falls back to a
plain-text acknowledgement.

### CLI Commands

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `/help` | Show a compact mobile guide to the main Chat2Codex commands. |
| `chat2codex` / `chat2codex start` | Start the adapter selected by `CHAT2CODEX_ADAPTER`. |
| `chat2codex setup --workdir <path>` | Create/connect a Feishu/Lark app and write `.env`. |
| `chat2codex setup weixin --workdir <path>` | Scan and connect a Weixin ClawBot and write private credentials plus `.env`. |
| `chat2codex init --workdir <path>` | Create a starter `.env` when you already have an app. |
| `chat2codex doctor` | Check `.env`, Node.js, Codex CLI and protocol-snapshot versions, workspace paths, and mobile/team-bot safety warnings. |
| `chat2codex smoke [--mode turn\|approval]` | Verify the Codex app-server protocol locally. |
| `chat2codex service print\|install\|uninstall` | Manage a user-level launchd/systemd service. |

By default, Chat2Codex stores configuration and runtime state under
`~/.chat2codex`. Set `CHAT2CODEX_HOME=/path/to/home` or pass `--env /path/to/.env`
when you need a separate bot instance.

## Features

- Feishu/Lark long connection or native Weixin ClawBot long polling; neither
  requires a public webhook server.
- One reusable Codex app-server session per logical task/thread scope. Multiple
  tasks in one Weixin conversation can own distinct sessions and threads; one
  task still runs only one turn at a time. Session-scoped grants never cross a
  task boundary.
- `/help`, `/status`, `/host`, `/projects`, `/project <index|path>`, `/threads`,
  `/history`, `/search`, `/resume`, `/fork`, `/archive`, `/archived`, `/unarchive`,
  `/retry`, `/usage`, `/advisor`, `/advisor approve <proposal-id>`,
  `/advisor reject <proposal-id>`, `/service status|logs|restart`, `/compact`, `/plan <task>`, `/new`,
  `/cd <path>`,
  `/stop`, `/steer`, `/answer`, `/mcp-answer`, `/approve`, `/permit`,
  `/mcp-decide`, `/summary`, `/files`, `/diff`, `/logs`, and `/whoami` commands.
- Local state in JSON.
- UsageAdvisor accepts only the closed signal set
  `task_target_clarification`, `abandoned_image_draft`, `routing_correction`,
  `delivery_retry`, `ownership_conflict`, and `recovery_action`. Current limits
  are proposal threshold: 3, aggregate cap: 6, proposal cap: 6, and recent timestamp cap: 8.
  Proposal text is rebuilt from code templates and includes
  observation, evidence, benefit, risks, scope, rollback, and verification.
  `/advisor approve` records `approve_for_planning`; `/advisor reject` is
  terminal. Neither action runs Codex or changes configuration or permissions.
- Codex app-server JSON-RPC for machine-readable progress, final output, and
  approval callbacks.
- A processing reaction on the original message, throttled plain-text progress,
  and a failure reaction when a run fails. `/stop`, `/retry`, and the run-detail
  commands remain ordinary text commands.
- Feishu/Lark approval cards for Codex command/file-change approval requests.
  Buttons are generated from Codex's current approval decisions, including
  Approve, Approve session, Deny, and Cancel turn when those options are
  offered.
- `/plan <task>` runs one turn in Codex Plan mode. Structured Codex
  `requestUserInput` questions are rendered as sender-bound cards,
  with an explicit `/answer <reply-code> <value>` fallback for free-form input.
  Options are validated against the original request; secret questions fail
  closed instead of collecting credentials through chat history.
- Standard MCP form and URL elicitations rendered as sender-bound cards. Typed
  form fields can also use
  `/mcp-answer <reply-code> <JSON-quoted-field-id> <value>`; values are validated
  against the original schema, while sensitive fields fail closed.
- Additional-permission requests from `item/permissions/requestApproval`
  rendered as complete-profile approval cards. Chat2Codex exposes only deny,
  turn-scoped grant, and session-scoped grant; a grant always returns the
  original profile requested by Codex.
- Text-only adapters receive sender-bound, expiring eight-character reply codes:
  `/approve <code> <number>` maps only to the original Codex decision array,
  `/permit <code> <deny|turn|session>` maps only to the three permission
  decisions, and `/mcp-decide <code> <accept|decline|cancel>` handles MCP URL
  decisions.
- Weixin is deliberately direct-message only. It accepts text, quoted text,
  inbound images, and inbound files; decrypts official CDN media with
  AES-128-ECB; uploads explicitly declared output images/files with fresh
  AES-128-ECB keys; maps processing reactions to typing; and drops groups,
  voice/video, and unsupported media with diagnostics. In-place message updates
  are not supported.
- Weixin Phase 1 natural orchestration creates and selects named tasks, routes
  new tasks across six configured workspace kinds, prefixes task-specific
  progress, questions, approvals, and terminal replies with a compact label such
  as `[Japan hotels]`, and keeps task status/recovery independent inside one
  conversation.
- Safe task concurrency uses persistent per-task Git worktrees, verified private
  output directories for non-Git output-only work, or a canonical-workspace FIFO
  fallback. Different workspaces may overlap up to the global run limit.
- Feishu/Lark image and file messages downloaded to local paths and passed to
  Codex with the prompt.
- Event diagnostics in logs and `/status` for recent routed/dropped messages.
- Operational `/status` details for queue depth, active run age, approval wait
  age, and recent failures.
- `/host` health card for the bridge host, Codex binary, default cwd, queue,
  active run count, approval wait count, and mobile/team-bot safety warnings.
- Runtime steering with `/steer <instruction>` for sending follow-up guidance to
  the active Codex turn without waiting behind the chat queue.
- Search, history, fork, and compact controls for Codex app-server threads from
  chat, so mobile users can continue older work without returning to the host.
- Optional run and approval timeouts for unattended team bot deployments.
- Team-bot friendly error summaries when Codex fails or cannot start.
- Final Codex replies rendered as Feishu/Lark rich-text posts.
- User-level launchd/systemd setup for long-running team deployments.

## Weixin Phase 1 Orchestration

Set `WEIXIN_NATURAL_ROUTING=true` and provide the strict workspace map as
single-line JSON. When the value is non-empty, all six keys are required, every
directory must already exist, and canonical paths must be distinct:

```dotenv
CHAT2CODEX_WORKSPACE_ROUTES={"work":"F:/workspace/workbuddy/Work","travel":"F:/workspace/workbuddy/Travel","personal":"F:/workspace/workbuddy/Personal","finance":"F:/workspace/workbuddy/Finance","ai_lab":"F:/workspace/workbuddy/AI-Lab","learning":"F:/workspace/workbuddy/Learning"}
```

If the map is empty, `CODEX_WORKDIR` is the only `work` route. A direct message
may explicitly select another existing directory; group-path authorization
continues to use `CODEX_GROUP_ALLOWED_ROOTS`. Existing tasks retain their saved
workspace even if later text would classify differently.

The scheduler selects the safest available execution mode:

| Workspace and request | Execution directory | Concurrency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Git repository | `<CHAT2CODEX_HOME>/worktrees/<taskId>` on branch `chat2codex/<taskId>` | Distinct tasks may overlap |
| Non-Git, explicitly output-only | `<workspace>/outputs/tasks/<taskId>` | Overlap only after the installed-Codex sandbox probe proves source writes are denied |
| Non-Git mutation, unknown intent, or failed isolation probe | Canonical workspace | FIFO per canonical workspace |

Worktrees persist across turns and are not automatically merged, deleted, or
reset. Use normal Git review and merge operations. Output-only tasks can read the
canonical source by absolute path but receive a per-turn writable root containing
only their private output directory. If the installed Codex version cannot prove
that contract, Chat2Codex reports the fallback and serializes the task. All modes
remain bounded by `CODEX_MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS`, and turns for the same task are
always FIFO.

Task-specific replies start with a sanitized label of at most 20 Unicode code
points. `/status` reports bounded task state, workspace kind, isolation mode,
queue reason, age, interaction wait, and a thread preview without returning full
prompts, reply codes, secrets, or file contents. Existing slash commands in
[Chat Commands](#chat-commands) are still supported; natural language is the
primary Weixin interface, especially when naming one of several active tasks.

Legacy state is migrated deterministically into the current task-aware schema v5. Before
the first migrated save, the original state file is retained as
`<BRIDGE_STATE_PATH>.v3.bak`; the prior chat/thread becomes one imported task.
Queued task jobs retain their execution metadata, while work that was already
running is marked interrupted and is never replayed automatically. Future,
unknown schema versions fail closed.

Phase 1 includes inbound images and natural multi-task control. Phase 2 adds the
explicit outbound image/file pipeline below. The bounded, redacted, review-only
UsageAdvisor foundation is implemented. Codex desktop live status/same-thread
handoff and controlled Weixin groups keep their separate acceptance gates.

## Weixin Phase 2 Outbound Results

Codex may send task deliverables only by ending its untruncated final answer with
one exact control line. The line is removed from the visible answer:

```text
CHAT2CODEX_OUTPUT_FILES: ["C:\\absolute\\report.png","C:\\absolute\\notes.pdf"]
```

The value must be a JSON array of at most 16 non-empty absolute paths. A malformed,
duplicate, non-final, or unsafe declaration sends one task-labelled correction
and no files. Ordinary path mentions, input attachments, changed files, diffs,
command output, and logs never imply consent to send a file.

Declared files must be regular, canonical, non-symlink files inside the task
workspace, its exact task Git worktree, or its verified private output-only
directory. Configured per-file and per-turn quotas apply. Chat2Codex snapshots
the bytes into private immutable staging before committing the terminal result.
The visible text chunks are delivered first, followed by images/files in declared
order as separate native Weixin messages. A failed upload leaves that entry and
later entries pending; retry or restart resumes the first undelivered entry with
the same delivery identity and never reruns Codex or resends a confirmed prefix.
`/status` shows only bounded kind, filename, and remaining count. Staged bytes are
cleaned only after the entire delivery group is terminal and older than
`OUTBOUND_MEDIA_RETENTION_HOURS`.

## Codex App-Server Guardrails

Chat2Codex uses the experimental `codex app-server --stdio` protocol for
thread control, progress events, and approval callbacks. After installing or
upgrading Codex CLI, first run:

```bash
chat2codex doctor
```

`doctor` compares the exact detected `codex --version` output with the Codex
version recorded in the bundled protocol snapshot. A mismatch, or a missing or
unreadable snapshot manifest, is a compatibility warning rather than a failed
doctor run. Treat it as unverified protocol compatibility and continue with the
fast local smoke test:

```bash
chat2codex smoke
```

This validates `initialize` and `thread/start` against a temporary workspace
without starting a model turn. To verify a full model-backed turn as well:

```bash
chat2codex smoke --mode turn
```

Historical-turn forks use a stricter compatibility gate. `/fork --turn` stops
before sending `thread/fork` unless the running app-server version exactly
matches the bundled protocol snapshot. Older servers may ignore `lastTurnId`
and silently create a whole-thread fork; ordinary `/fork` keeps its existing
compatibility behavior.

To verify a real command-approval request, run:

```bash
chat2codex smoke --mode approval
```

That mode uses a temporary workspace, `approvalPolicy=untrusted`, and
`sandbox=workspace-write`. It prompts Codex to create `approval-smoke.txt`,
requires the app-server to emit `item/commandExecution/requestApproval`, returns
`accept`, waits for `turn/completed`, and checks the file content.

The current generated protocol snapshot lives under
[`docs/codex-app-server-protocol`](docs/codex-app-server-protocol/). Refresh it
after Codex CLI upgrades:

```bash
bun run protocol:generate
git diff -- docs/codex-app-server-protocol
```

Review schema diffs before changing
[`src/agent/codex-runner.ts`](src/agent/codex-runner.ts). Chat2Codex handles only
explicitly supported app-server server requests. Unknown methods return a
JSON-RPC method-not-found error; malformed approval requests return an
invalid-params error without exposing or inventing an approval option.
`item/tool/requestUserInput` is supported for `/plan <task>` turns through
cards and explicit `/answer` replies; request fields and callback answers are
revalidated, withdrawn requests reject late replies, and `isSecret` questions
fail closed because chat cannot guarantee masked input. Standard
`mcpServer/elicitation/request` form and
URL requests are supported through cards, with `/mcp-answer` for typed form
values. The bridge does not persist or echo `requestUserInput` or MCP answer
values, and sensitive form fields fail closed. The OpenAI-specific MCP form
extension is not negotiated.

`item/permissions/requestApproval` is also supported through a sender-bound
card that discloses the complete requested permission profile. The only bridge
decisions are `deny`, `grantTurn`, and `grantSession`. A grant clones the exact
original profile held by the runner; card payloads cannot replace permissions
or enable `strictAutoReview`. Malformed, incomplete, withdrawn, or undisplayable
requests fail closed.

When `CODEX_APPROVAL_POLICY` allows interactive approvals, Codex app-server
emits approval requests while a turn is running. Chat2Codex posts a separate
approval card to the same chat and pauses Codex until an authorized user clicks
one of the options. The card buttons mirror Codex's `availableDecisions` for
command execution requests. The current file-change approval request does not
include target files or patch details, so Chat2Codex exposes only decline/cancel
until those details can be correlated and rendered completely. If command
decisions are absent or `null`, the bridge likewise exposes only decline/cancel;
a malformed decision list is rejected as invalid params.
Cards disclose additional filesystem/network permissions and every exact
exec/network policy rule. If security-relevant details cannot be rendered
completely, allow actions are removed and only decline/cancel remain; the
message router enforces the same decision filter when processing card callbacks.

Apps created with the current `chat2codex setup` flow include that callback.
If you created the Feishu/Lark app before interactive approvals and input cards
were added, manually subscribe the `card.action.trigger` callback in the
developer console so those card decisions can reach this bridge over the long
connection.

If you created the app before attachment support was added, also grant the
message resource/read permission used by Feishu/Lark's
`im.v1.messageResource.get` API; otherwise attachment downloads will fail even
though text messages still work.

Group messages are ignored unless they explicitly mention the bot. To enable a
group chat, first send `@Chat2Codex /whoami` in that chat and copy the reported
`chat_id`. Then set:

```env
ALLOW_GROUPS=true
ALLOWED_CHAT_IDS=oc_xxx
```

Group `/whoami` replies expose only `chat_id`, chat type, and the access
decision. Sender ids are intentionally omitted from group history; use a direct
message `/whoami` when an administrator needs the sender's available ids.

## Team Bot Deployment

For a team group, keep the bot allowlisted and run it as a user-level background
service instead of leaving `chat2codex start` in a terminal.

1. In the target group, send `@Chat2Codex /whoami` and copy the reported
   `chat_id`.
2. Update `~/.chat2codex/.env`:

   ```env
   ALLOW_GROUPS=true
   ALLOWED_CHAT_IDS=oc_xxx
   ALLOWED_USER_IDS=ou_xxx,ou_yyy
   CODEX_WORKDIR=/absolute/path/to/your/repo
   CODEX_GROUP_ALLOWED_ROOTS=/absolute/path/to/your/repo,/absolute/path/to/team/repos
   CODEX_BIN=/absolute/path/to/codex
   CODEX_APPROVAL_POLICY=on-request
   CODEX_RUN_TIMEOUT_MS=1800000
   CODEX_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_MS=300000
   ATTACHMENT_DOWNLOAD_DIR=/absolute/path/to/chat2codex-attachments
   ```

   `CODEX_BIN` should be absolute for background services because launchd and
   systemd do not load your interactive shell startup files.
   Use `CODEX_APPROVAL_POLICY=never` for unattended bots that should never wait
   for a Feishu/Lark approval click.
   Leave `CODEX_RUN_TIMEOUT_MS=0` and `CODEX_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_MS=0` to disable
   automatic timeouts; set positive millisecond values when team bots should
   fail fast instead of waiting forever.

3. Preview the service file:

   ```bash
   chat2codex service print
   ```

4. Install the user service:

   ```bash
   chat2codex service install
   ```

   On macOS this installs a launchd agent named `com.chat2codex.bridge`. On
   Linux this installs a systemd user service named `chat2codex.service`.
   Re-run `chat2codex service install` after upgrading from an older release to
   install the supervisor marker required by `/service restart`.

Useful service commands:

```bash
# macOS status and logs
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.chat2codex.bridge
tail -f ~/.chat2codex/.data/logs/chat2codex.out.log ~/.chat2codex/.data/logs/chat2codex.err.log

# Linux status and logs
systemctl --user status chat2codex
journalctl --user -u chat2codex -f

# Uninstall the user service
chat2codex service uninstall
```

The default launchd log directory is `~/.chat2codex/.data/logs` for both npm
installs and source checkouts. Foreground development with `bun run dev` logs to
the terminal instead. File logging uses bounded entries and rotates according
to `LOG_FILE_MAX_BYTES` and `LOG_FILE_MAX_FILES`. A source checkout that
intentionally wants project-local service logs can override them explicitly:

```bash
bun src/index.ts service install --env .env --project-dir . \
  --stdout .data/logs/chat2codex.out.log \
  --stderr .data/logs/chat2codex.err.log
```

## Chat Commands

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `/status` | Show current chat session, cwd, queue depth, active run age, approval wait age, recent failures, attachment directory, and recent event diagnostics. |
| `/host` | Send a Host health card with Codex CLI availability, service paths, queue/approval counts, and mobile/team-bot safety warnings. `/health` is an alias. |
| `/projects` | List projects discovered from Codex app-server threads, grouped by cwd. |
| `/project <index\|path>` | Enter a listed project by number, or switch to a directory path, and start with no selected thread. |
| `/threads` | List recent Codex conversations for the current project. `/sessions` is an alias. |
| `/history [index\|turn_id]` | Show recent turns for the current conversation; pass a listed number or turn id to show turn details. |
| `/search <term>` | Search Codex conversation history and save results for `/resume <index>` or `/fork <index>`. |
| `/resume <index\|thread_id>` | Continue a listed conversation by number, or load one directly by Codex thread id. |
| `/fork [index\|thread_id]` | Fork the current, listed, or specified Codex conversation and switch this chat to the new thread. |
| `/fork --turn <history-index\|turn_id>` | Fork the current conversation through a selected non-running turn. Use an index from `/history` or pass a turn id directly; the source thread stays unchanged and local files are not restored. |
| `/retry` | Retry the latest task remembered in this bridge process for the same chat and original sender. Restarting the bridge clears this exact-prompt retry context. |
| `/usage` | Show the latest turn and cumulative thread token usage plus context-window occupancy when Codex provides it. |
| `/advisor` | List at most six bounded, redacted UsageAdvisor proposals. |
| `/advisor approve <proposal-id>` | Record `approve_for_planning`; this permits planning only and applies no change. |
| `/advisor reject <proposal-id>` | Reject the proposal terminally; this applies no change. |
| `/archive` | Archive the currently selected Codex thread and clear it from the chat without changing local files. |
| `/archived` | List archived threads for the current project. |
| `/unarchive <archived-index\|thread_id>` | Restore an archived thread. Use `/threads` and `/resume` afterward to continue it. |
| `/service status` | Show bridge PID, uptime, queue state, restart availability, and log source. |
| `/service logs` | Show a bounded recent service-log tail. Direct message plus an explicit `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` match is required. |
| `/service restart` | Gracefully restart a supervisor-managed bridge. Uses the same admin boundary as logs and refuses while work is active or queued. |
| `/compact` | Request compaction for the current Codex conversation. |
| `/plan <task>` | Run one task in Codex Plan mode. Use this mode when Codex should call `request_user_input`; the next ordinary message returns to Default mode. |
| `/new` | Start a fresh Codex conversation in the current project. |
| `/cd <path>` | Change the current chat cwd and start a fresh Codex thread. |
| `/stop` | Stop the active Codex run for the current chat. This command bypasses queued chat work. |
| `/steer <instruction>` | Send extra guidance to the active Codex run immediately, bypassing queued chat work. |
| `/answer <reply-code> <value>` | Answer the current non-secret Codex `requestUserInput` question. The reply code is shown on the question card; answers bypass queued chat work and are neither persisted nor echoed by the bridge. |
| `/mcp-answer <reply-code> <JSON-quoted-field-id> <value>` | Answer the current non-sensitive MCP form field using the exact command shown on its card. `/skip` skips an optional field; quote the value as `"/skip"` when that literal string is intended. Typed values are checked against the original schema; answers bypass queued chat work and are neither persisted nor echoed by the bridge. |
| `/approve <reply-code> <option-number>` | Resolve a Codex command/file approval on text-only adapters; the number maps only to the original decision array. |
| `/permit <reply-code> <deny\|turn\|session>` | Deny additional permissions or grant them for the current turn/session. |
| `/mcp-decide <reply-code> <accept\|decline\|cancel>` | Resolve an MCP URL request on text-only adapters. |
| `/summary` | Show the most recent run summary for this chat. |
| `/files` | Show changed files from the most recent run. |
| `/diff` | Show the latest captured diff from the most recent run. |
| `/logs` | Show command summaries and captured output previews from the most recent run. |
| `/whoami` | Show the current `chat_id`, chat type, and access decision; sender ids are included only in direct messages. |

## Safety Defaults

Chat2Codex defaults to `CODEX_SANDBOX=workspace-write`, so Codex can edit inside the selected workspace. Use `read-only` for safer Q&A-only bots.

It defaults to `CODEX_APPROVAL_POLICY=never` for unattended operation. Set
`CODEX_APPROVAL_POLICY=on-request` or `untrusted` when you want Codex approval
requests to appear as Feishu/Lark cards. In group chats, approval buttons can
only be handled by users listed in `ALLOWED_USER_IDS`.

`CODEX_APPROVALS_REVIEWER=auto_review` routes approval requests through Codex's
automated risk reviewer; set it to `user` for direct review. It is independent
of `CODEX_APPROVAL_POLICY` and `CODEX_SANDBOX` and never widens either.

`CODEX_RUN_TIMEOUT_MS=0` and `CODEX_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_MS=0` disable automatic
timeouts. For long-running background bots, set positive millisecond values so a
stuck Codex turn or unattended approval request is cancelled and recorded in
`/status` as a recent failure with a recovery hint.

Key production resource paths are bounded by default and can be tuned with the
positive-integer settings in [`.env.example`](.env.example):
`CODEX_MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS`, `CODEX_MAX_APP_SERVER_SESSIONS`, the global and per-chat
`BRIDGE_MAX_PENDING_MESSAGES` / `BRIDGE_MAX_PENDING_MESSAGES_PER_CHAT` limits,
which bound active jobs, undelivered durable replies, pending control messages,
and in-turn approval/input waits,
attachment count/file/message/store quotas plus `ATTACHMENT_RETENTION_HOURS`,
chat/stderr/run-log/diff output limits, log entry/file rotation limits, and
terminal job/delivered-outbox retention counts.
Active jobs and undelivered outbox entries are never removed by retention
pruning. Attachments are streamed into private temporary files, checked against
the configured quotas, atomically finalized, and lazily expired without
following symlinks.

Reusable app-server sessions are held only in memory. Idle sessions expire
after `CODEX_APP_SERVER_IDLE_TTL_MS` (15 minutes by default), and the least
recently used idle session is closed when `CODEX_MAX_APP_SERVER_SESSIONS` is
reached. Changing the sender identity, cwd, thread, policy, `/new` epoch, or
using `/fork`/`/compact` closes the old owner before another process can attach.
Messages without a stable sender id use a single-turn process and cannot inherit
session-scoped grants. A graceful `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` closes the Lark connection
and all Codex children; queued durable work remains recoverable, while running
work is marked interrupted and is never replayed automatically.

`chat2codex doctor` and `/host` both surface mobile/team-bot safety warnings,
including relative `CODEX_BIN`, group chats without `ALLOWED_USER_IDS`,
disabled run/approval timeouts, and high-risk sandbox settings.

If a chat's selected cwd is deleted, an `ENOENT` startup failure is treated as
a missing workspace rather than a missing Codex binary. Chat2Codex clears the
selected thread, switches the chat back to `CODEX_WORKDIR` when that directory
is still allowed, and asks the user to resend the task. If the default cwd is
also unavailable, use `/cd <existing-directory>` before retrying.

Direct-message routing is enabled by default, but messages other than `/whoami`
must come from a sender in `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` or a direct chat in
`ALLOWED_CHAT_IDS`. Group messages must mention the bot and require all three:
`ALLOW_GROUPS=true`, an allowed chat, and a sender in `ALLOWED_USER_IDS`.
Authorized direct messages can switch to any local directory. Group chats are
constrained to canonical paths under `CODEX_GROUP_ALLOWED_ROOTS`, or under
`CODEX_WORKDIR` when that list is empty; symlinks cannot bypass the boundary.

Incoming events are persisted to a pending inbox before the long-connection
handler returns. Codex prompts also create durable jobs before execution. A
queued job can resume after restart; a job that had reached `running` is marked
interrupted and is not automatically executed again because its side effects
cannot be inferred safely. Terminal replies are delivered from a durable outbox
with stable idempotency keys, so a chat-delivery failure does not rerun Codex.
After restart, read-only control messages such as `/status` may be replayed;
mutating or run-targeted controls such as `/new`, `/stop`, and `/steer` are not
replayed onto another task. A message previously classified as non-Codex cannot
be promoted into a Codex run solely because access or routing configuration
changed during restart.
Codex runs targeting different workspaces can run in parallel up to
`CODEX_MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS`. Tasks in one workspace overlap only when each has a
separate Git worktree or a verified output-only directory; canonical non-Git
work remains FIFO across conversations. Global and per-chat queue admission is
rejected before Codex starts when its
configured limit is reached. `/status` and `/stop` also cover runs waiting for a
workspace or global permit. Only one bridge process may use a given
`BRIDGE_STATE_PATH`. Keep approvals and Git review enabled for sensitive work,
and inspect the thread/worktree before manually retrying an interrupted job.

The instance lock is removed on normal shutdown. A `SIGKILL` or fatal runtime
crash can leave `<BRIDGE_STATE_PATH>.lock`; after confirming that no bridge
process is running, remove that lock directory before restarting. It is never
reclaimed automatically because doing so can race with another startup.

Do not run this bot in a group with untrusted people while using broad filesystem access. A chat bot that can drive a local coding agent is effectively a remote control surface for your machine.

## Runtime Shape

The npm package runs the built Node.js ESM entrypoint. For local development from
a source checkout, use Bun:

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

Use `bun run start:bun` only after validating the Feishu SDK long-connection path in your environment.

Chat2Codex is an unofficial project and is not affiliated with OpenAI.

## Testing

```bash
bun run check
```

This runs application and adapter-contract type checking, the Bun test suite,
architecture-boundary checks, and the production build. Use `bun audit` to
check the Bun dependency lockfile.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for local development and pull request
guidance. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before running Chat2Codex in a shared
chat or reporting a security issue.

## Next Features To Add

1. Complete production and real-client acceptance for ordered Weixin outbound media.
2. Add Codex desktop live status and one-writer same-thread handoff.
3. Expand UsageAdvisor signal coverage only through reviewed, bounded changes.
4. Optionally move adapters behind an external gateway when deployments need
   process-level credential and SDK isolation.
